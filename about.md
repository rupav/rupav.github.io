<p>Hi, I am Rupav Jain. I will be graduating with a B.E degree 
from NSIT, DU in 2020. I will be joining Goibibo as a SDE-1 in July 2020. 
Looking forward for the new chapter. Happy Coding :)</p>

<p>I have been involved quite a lot in both open source development and 
competitive coding. Learning hacks in Vim editor and watching football
are my hobbies.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>I was a Software Engineer Intern at Western Digital, Bangalore in summer 2019.
My work mainly involved in C language. I implemented their internal protocol
on Oakgate platform from scratch. This internship introduced me to the
corporate world, helped me work on a production-based codebase, write scalable
and clean code.</p>

<p>I was selected in Google Summer of Code 2018 by UNL. I worked with Helikar 
Lab, UNL on their project <a href="https://github.com/helikarlab/candis">'Candis'</a>.
This was a great learning experience (big thanks to my Mentor, <a href="https://github.com/achillesrasquinha/">Achilles</a>). You can read about my work on Candis from
<a href="https://github.com/helikarlab/candis/wiki#google-summer-of-code-2018">here</a>.</p>
